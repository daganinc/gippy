## [v0.3.0]
- License changed from GPL v2 to Apache 2.0
- Added test framework
- Separated into python modules: gippy (core), gippy.tests, gippy.algorithms
- Cleaned up setup to use single 'gippy' distro directory
- Refactored: new base class GeoResource (linked to GDALMajorObject)
- Chunking code moved from GeoData to new ChunkSet class
- Removed 'chunking by chunk index' feature (poor implementation made it error prone)

- Added SpectralCovariance and RXD (RX Anomoly detector) to algorithms
- Added GeoVectorResource, GeoVector, GeoFeature classes
- Added GeoImages class as collection of GeoImage objects
- Refactored CookieCutter
- Properly clear functions after image has been Processed to itself (written to own file)
- Stop opening GDALDataset as shared, which causes problems when user expects a different object
- Iterable containers: GeoImage (bands), GeoImages (images), GeoVector (features), GeoFeatures (attributes)
- Added SetGCPs function to GeoResource
- Added additional functions for retriving and searching values of attributes in vectors

## v0.2.4
- Added Affine to get affine transformation for SRS
- Python bindings now correctly handling Point data type (returned as tuple)

## v0.2.3
- Changed name of secondary probability image in fmask algorithm to -prob (from _prob)
- Suppressed stderr messages from GDAL (these should all be handled internally by GIPPY)

## v0.2.2
- Fixed bug in Indices algorithm

## v0.2.1
- Added SpectralStatistics algorithm and functions to GeoImage and GeoAlgorithms
- Added additional gdal helper functions
- Additional chunking functions and options. Chunking added to TimeSeries
- Cleanup

## [v0.2.0]
- Added BrowseImage for creating an RGB or single band JPG image from a GeoImage for easy viewing
- Refactored color management (removed class, uses single vector of band names)
- misc fixes
- Added ApplyMask
- Updated swig bindings to properly support numpy arrays as input
- CookieCutter now properly uses cutline

## v0.1.9
- Added TimeSeries, Extract, GetRandomPixels, GetPixelClasses functions to GeoImage python bindings
- Standardized datatypes using stdint.h for better interoperability
